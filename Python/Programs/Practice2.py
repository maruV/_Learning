# Here is a 2-dimensional data structure

data = [
		[  2,  5,  1,3.4,  9],
		[  8,  0, -2,  6,  2],
		[ .1, 10, -3, .6, 12],
		[2.2,-.4,  4,  4, -8]
	   ]

# Write the following code without assuming you know how many rows and columns are in data

# 1. Find the sum of each row and print these sums, one per line

for row in data:
    print("Sum of a row:", sum(row))

# 2. Find the sum of each column and print these sums, one per line.


# 3. Find and print the smallest number in data


# 4. Find the row that has the largest product.  Print the product and the row number.


# 5. Add an additional row to data.  The row's contents are the sum of the corresponding
#    Elements in the current first and last rows.


# 6. Print data as a rectangular array of numbers so that rows and columns are aligned.


# 7. Create a new list of lists (different size) to assign to data and repeat the above.
